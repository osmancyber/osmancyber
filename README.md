# Hello, I'm Corbin!
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbin-osman-35743328b/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a 2024 graduate looking to further my knowledge and skills within the fields of cybersecurity and digital forensics. I am enthusiastic about learning and growing and hope to deepen my technical knowledge and experience in the work field.

Take a look around to see the various things that I have learned and performed. Review the papers I've written for a glimpse into my knowledge on various topics, or explore the skills I've gained and the tools I have experience with to know what I offer from a professional standpoint.

## Objective

My goal is to transition into the field of cybersecurity through an internship or entry-level role that allows me to gain hands-on experience and technical knowledge. While working full-time I also aim to further my education and skill set through continued studies and earning certifications.

I am interested in on-site, remote, and hybrid positions and opportunities. I am willing to relocate with my family with enough time given in advance.
