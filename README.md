I am a 2024 graduate looking to further my knowledge and skills within the fields of cybersecurity and digital forensics. I am enthusiastic about learning and growing and hope to deepen my technical knowledge and experience in the work field.

## Objective

My goal is to transition into the field of cybersecurity through an internship or entry-level role that allows me to gain hands-on experience and technical knowledge. While working full-time I also aim to further my education and skill set through continued studies and earning certifications.

I am interested in on-site, remote, and hybrid positions and opportunities. I am willing to relocate with my family with enough time given in advance.
